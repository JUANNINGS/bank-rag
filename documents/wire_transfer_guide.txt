## Security and Fraud Prevention



### Verifying Recipient Information



**CRITICAL:** Always verify recipient details directly with the recipient before sending money.



**Common International Transfer Scams:**

- **Business Email Compromise:** Scammer poses as supplier/vendor with changed bank details

- **Property Purchase Scams:** Fake emails from "solicitor" with different settlement account

- **Romance Scams:** Online relationship leads to money transfer requests

- **Investment Scams:** "Guaranteed returns" requiring upfront overseas transfers

- **Impersonation:** Scammer poses as family member in urgent need



### Security Best Practices



**DO:**

- ✅ Verify recipient details through known phone number (not from email)

- ✅ Double-check SWIFT codes, IBANs, and account numbers

- ✅ Use small test transfer first for new recipients ($100-$200)

- ✅ Keep transfer receipt for records

- ✅ Be suspicious of urgent transfer requests

- ✅ Verify unexpected changes to payment instructions



**DON'T:**

- ❌ Send money to someone you've never met in person

- ❌ Send based solely on email instructions

- ❌ Send money for online purchases from unknown sellers

- ❌ Send money to claim lottery/prize winnings

- ❌ Send money as advance payment for loans or investments

- ❌ Trust caller ID alone (can be spoofed)



### Red Flags

- Pressure to send money urgently

- Request to send money to receive money

- Request to send money for visa/immigration purposes

- Inability or unwillingness to meet in person

- Request for secrecy about the transfer

- Poor spelling/grammar in communications

- Deals that seem "too good to be true"
